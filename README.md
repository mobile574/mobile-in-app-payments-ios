# Square In-App Payments iOS SDK

Build remarkable payments experiences in your own apps with Square’s [In-App Payments SDK](https://docs.connect.squareup.com/payments/in-app-payments-sdk/what-it-does). Use our pre-built UI to collect sensitive credit card details from your customers, while matching the look and feel of your app. Square takes care of all the complexity of payments - security, risk, and PCI compliance are managed for you, so that you can focus on building the rest of your application.

You can also pair our Square In-App Payments SDK with Square’s [Online Payments APIs](https://squareup.com/developers/online-payment-apis) and [Reader SDK](https://squareup.com/developers/reader-sdk) to accept payments across all channels - online, in-person and in-app - while keeping your back office reporting unified in a single system.
